    "## 1. Background\n",
    "The body fat percentage (BFP) of a human is the total mass of fat divided by total body mass, multiplied by 100. Body fat is a measure of obesity, plays an important role in various health outcomes such as life expectancy, prognosis for disease, healthcare costs, and the general well-being of individuals. Current measurement technique including underwater weighing, Whole-body air displacement plethysmography (ADP), Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry are usually inconvenient/costly. A simple, robust, accurate and precise  “rule-of-thumb” method to estimate percentage of body fat using clinically available measurements is in need. Our analysis and model is based on a real data set of 252 men with measurements of their percentage of body fat and various body circumference measurements."

    "The first thing to check is whether there are any apparently wrong records. According to Siri's equation (BODYFAT=495/DENSITY-450), we draw a plot of BODYFAT vs. 1/DENSITY to find anomalies. The 182th, 96th, 76th and 48th records should be dropped since they don't comply with the equation and we can't decide if we should believe BODYFAT or DENSITY or neither. According to the BMI equation (BMI=Weight/Height^2), similarly, we draw a plot and find that No. 42, 163 and 221 are far away from the theoretical line. We correct their height using their weight and adiposity."

Their bodyfat are 1.9$\\%$ and 45.1$\\%$. According to American Council on Exercise, the minimum bodyfat is about 2$\\%$. 45.1$\\%$ is a possible value based on our research. Therefore, we keep both of them. To detect outliers for explanatory variables, we adapt pairwise scatter plots. No. 39, 41 and 212 are always far away from the majority. We then use star plots to compare these three with the other records and decide to delete 39, 41 and keep 212."

Considering the fact that the sample size is relatively small, a full model must include redundant variables, which leads to problems such as overfitting and collinearity. Also, it's common sense that users are more willing to use a simple model. Therefore, in this section, we use exhaustive model selection method to select variables under several criteria (AIC, BIC, Mallow's Cp and $\\Delta R^2$). Then we use $k$-fold to choose the best model with least MSE (Mean Squared Error).\n",
